# IDSpace
Privacy by design, portable and interoperable personal databases where users, objects and organizations can keep their data and control access to it. It’s the basis of the Identity and holds all of the credentials (created by others) belonging to the entity, verified contacts and interactions with other identities.

| Credential | Contact (DID) | Interaction | Permissions |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| I’m client at the bank | Bank | Payments/Transfers | Can send me emails |
| I’m insured | Insurance Company | Claims | Can read my e-watch and get a health ranking |

Identity Containers, to be usable they need a platform to hold the DIDs (Blockchain - Polkadot) and encrypted communication channels to send and receive credentials.
